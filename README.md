# Maximum likelihood grading

An IRT-like method to assign grades based on an exam.

Exams are difficult to design and hard to grade, once students made the exam. This project tries to improve the grading process. Instead of counting points, we use statistics to find an ability parameter for each student such that the exam outcome is explained best. These ability parameters can then be converted to grades.
